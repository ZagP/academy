# Project FilmApp

FilmApp is an integration of the API services made available by TMDb (https://www.themoviedb.org), implementing movie search and detail display.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#Node.js
Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later.

To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.

#npm package manager
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

This setup guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.

#Install the Angular CLI
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing


Download repository with this code in a terminal/console:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZagP/academy

Next step, you need to go in the directory FilmApp and next install FilmApp with the following command:


```
